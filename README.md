# ABAP-ADT-API MCP-Server

## Description

The ABAP-ADT-API MCP-Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to facilitate seamless communication between ABAP systems and MCP clients. It is based on [abap-adt-api](https://github.com/marcellourbani/abap-adt-api/) and provides a suite of tools and resources for managing ABAP objects, handling transport requests, performing code analysis, and more, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of ABAP development workflows.

This project was generated by Cline.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Securely authenticate with ABAP systems using the `login` tool.
- **Object Management**: Create, read, update, and delete ABAP objects seamlessly.
- **Transport Handling**: Manage transport requests with tools like `createTransport` and `transportInfo`.
- **Code Analysis**: Perform syntax checks and retrieve code completion suggestions.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the server with additional tools and resources as needed.
- **Session Management**: Handle session caching and termination using `dropSession` and `logout`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **ABAP System Access**: Credentials and URL to access the ABAP system.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/mario-andreschak/mcp-abap-abap-adt-api.git
   cd mcp-abap-abap-adt-api
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```cmd
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   An `.env.example` file is provided in the root directory as a template for the required environment variables. To set up your environment:

   a. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```

   b. Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual SAP connection details:

      ```env
      SAP_URL=https://your-sap-server.com:44300
      SAP_USER=YOUR_SAP_USERNAME
      SAP_PASSWORD=YOUR_SAP_PASSWORD
      SAP_CLIENT=YOUR_SAP_CLIENT
      SAP_LANGUAGE=YOUR_SAP_LANGUAGE
      ```

   Note: The SAP_CLIENT and SAP_LANGUAGE variables are optional but recommended.

   If you're using self-signed certificates, you can also set:

   ```env
   NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED="0"
   ```

   IMPORTANT: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

4. **Build the Project**

   ```cmd
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Run the Server**

   ```cmd
   npm run start
   ```

   (or alternatively integrate the MCP Server into VSCode)

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it using MCP clients or tools that support the Model Context Protocol (e.g. [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline)).
