# ABAP-ADT-API MCP-Server

## Description

The ABAP-ADT-API MCP-Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to facilitate seamless communication between ABAP systems and MCP clients. It is based on [abap-adt-api](https://github.com/marcellourbani/abap-adt-api/) and provides a suite of tools and resources for managing ABAP objects, handling transport requests, performing code analysis, and more, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of ABAP development workflows.

This project was generated by Cline.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Securely authenticate with ABAP systems using the `login` tool.
- **Object Management**: Create, read, update, and delete ABAP objects seamlessly.
- **Transport Handling**: Manage transport requests with tools like `createTransport` and `transportInfo`.
- **Code Analysis**: Perform syntax checks and retrieve code completion suggestions.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the server with additional tools and resources as needed.
- **Session Management**: Handle session caching and termination using `dropSession` and `logout`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **ABAP System Access**: Credentials and URL to access the ABAP system.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mario-andreschak/mcp-abap-abap-adt-api.git
   cd mcp-abap-abap-adt-api
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:

   ```env
   SAP_URL="https://your-abap-system-url:port"
   SAP_USERNAME="your_username"
   SAP_PASSWORD="your_password"
   ```

   The following values are technically optional, but also possible:

   ```env
   SAP_CLIENT="your_logon_client"
   SAP_LANGUAGE="your_logon_languge"
   ```

   If you're using self-signed certificates, you can also set 

   ```env
   NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED="0"
   ```

4. **Build the Project**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Run the Server**

   ```bash
   node build/index.js
   ```

   (or alternatively integrate the MCP Server into VSCode)

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it using MCP clients or tools that support the Model Context Protocol (e.g. [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline)).
